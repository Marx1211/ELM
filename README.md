Coursework for Software Engineering.

The aim of tis project is to demonstrate the understanding of the studied software engineering principles taught in the module. The project was completed over the lapse of
two days, therefore it is lacking of refined aesthetics and proper architecture. The main known issue is the hard-coded path to the file containing the abbreviations, and 
the hard-coded path for the .json file output.
As a learning exercise, the project will be improved and corrected to have a proper MVC architecture, remove hard-coded methods to improve the detection of sender, subject and 
specific codes from the text input, and the GUI redesigned to have a better user experience.
